TemplateTrace - Description
================================================
TemplateTrace is a C++ compile-time raytracer written for the fun of it.
Run Raytrace.py specifying --width, --height and --output to generate an image.  
The script will invoke gcc on Main.cpp to generate two program instances at 
a time and with each program instance covering a 4x1 portion of the final 
generated image.  As you can imagine this can be a very lengthy process...  
Modify TestScene.h if you want to modify the scene being traced.
